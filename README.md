# Telugu-Open-Domain-Question-Answeing-System
This is an Intership in which I worked on a project named Telugu Open Domain Question Answering System. It is an NLP Project in which I implemented a model to do Question Answering in web-based applications for the Telugu language. A question which is in Telugu language  taken as  input and my model decides the answer type and searches in the web through search engines Bing and Google , extracts relevant data from top websites based on cosine similarity scores. Using Spacy NER tagging a single answer displayed as output in Telugu. This answer is the most accurate answer which is in the web. I have used libraries like BeautifulSoup, Googletrans, Spacy, Sklearn etc... and To implement Question Classification model I have used ML Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Multi Layer Perception, Support Vector Machines.
